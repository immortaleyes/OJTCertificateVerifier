# OJT Certificate Verifier

## Project Overview

**OJTCertificateVerifier** is a verification tool designed for validating certificates issued by Online Judge Training platforms (OJTs) such as **HackerRank**, **LeetCode**, **Codeforces**, and other coding challenge platforms. These platforms issue certificates to participants upon completion of courses or solving challenges. This tool ensures the authenticity of those certificates by cross-referencing the information against official records, ensuring that the certificates are legitimate and have not been tampered with.

The tool helps verify:
- The **validity** of the certificate.
- The **authenticity** of the certificate issuer.
- **Non-tampering** of the certificate data.
- **Consistency** between the certificate data and official records.

The **OJTCertificateVerifier** tool is particularly useful for employers, educational institutions, or anyone who wants to verify the credentials of an individual based on their online certification records from various competitive programming platforms.

## Features

### Key Features:
- **Certificate Verification**: Verifies the authenticity of certificates generated by online coding platforms.
- **Real-time Verification**: Checks the certificate details against the database of known issuers and official records.
- **Tamper Detection**: Detects any changes made to the certificate details after it has been issued.
- **Secure and Reliable**: Uses cryptographic algorithms to ensure the certificate hasn't been altered.
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Supports certificates from various online judge platforms, such as **LeetCode**, **HackerRank**, **Codeforces**, etc.
- **Batch Verification**: Allows you to verify multiple certificates in bulk, saving time for batch processing.
- **API Integration**: Option to integrate the tool with other platforms or services for automated verification.

## Technologies Used

The **OJTCertificateVerifier** project is built using the following technologies:

- **Frontend**:
  - **React.js**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for creating modern, responsive layouts.
  
- **Backend**:
  - **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime used for building the server-side of the application.
  - **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js to handle HTTP requests and responses.
  - **Database**: A relational or NoSQL database (like MongoDB or MySQL) to store user certificates and verification results.
  
- **Security**:
  - **JWT** (JSON Web Tokens) for secure API authentication.
  - **Hashing Algorithms** for verifying certificate integrity.
  
- **Other Tools**:
  - **Axios**: To make HTTP requests for communication with external APIs.
  - **Docker**: For containerization, ensuring the app works consistently across different environments.
  - **GitHub Actions**: For continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD).

## Installation

To get the **OJTCertificateVerifier** running locally, follow the steps below:

### Step 1: Clone the repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/immortaleyes/OJTCertificateVerifier.git
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Navigate into the project folder:

```bash
cd OJTCertificateVerifier
```

Install the necessary dependencies:

- If you're using **Node.js** for the backend:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

- If the project has a **frontend** setup with **React.js**, navigate to the `frontend` directory and run:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

### Step 3: Set up the Database

- Set up your database (e.g., **MongoDB** or **MySQL**) and configure the connection string in the `.env` file.
- If youâ€™re using **MongoDB**, install **MongoDB** locally or use **MongoDB Atlas** (a cloud service).

### Step 4: Run the Development Server

Start the backend server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the backend server on `http://localhost:5000`.

For the frontend (React.js), run:

```bash
npm start
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

### How to Verify a Certificate:

1. **Enter Certificate Details**: On the homepage, enter the certificate details such as certificate ID, student ID, and platform (e.g., **LeetCode**, **HackerRank**).
2. **Click 'Verify'**: Press the **Verify** button to submit the certificate for validation.
3. **Get Verification Results**: The tool will fetch the certificate data and check it against the official records, showing whether the certificate is valid, expired, or tampered with.
4. **Batch Verification**: For bulk verification, upload a CSV file with certificate details. The tool will verify each certificate in the file.

### Example:

1. Certificate ID: **12345678**
2. Platform: **HackerRank**
3. Student ID: **987654321**
